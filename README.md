## My Dotfiles

**ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Duncan and these are my Dotfiles.**

My Dotfiles serve as a crucial tool for me to maintain and manage the configuration of my computer. I try to keep everything nice & organised. You're more than welcome to take a look around and steal anything you want.

### Installation

- `git clone https://github.com/duncanmcclean/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
- `bash ~/.dotfiles/install`

### What's being used

- **[Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot)** for bootstrapping my dotfiles. Whenever I setup a new computer or wipe fresh, I only need to run a single Dotbot command to install software, create symlinks and configure stuff.
- **[Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)** is my shell.
- **[Hammerspoon](https://www.hammerspoon.org/)** for window management & keyboard shortcuts.
- **[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)** for dependency management
